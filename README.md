> I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Iâ€™ve decided to make this a public commitment.

## The Why
A couple of months ago I made a promise to myself; *spend an hour every day learning new stuff*. And yes, in the weekends I would watch a course or read some articles but the time devoted on learning was really inconsistent. 

By making this *public* I am trying to commit to this promise. The idea is to track my progress and keep a log of each day writing down the stuff I learned and the tasks I completed along the way.

## The Rules
* I will code for at least an hour every day.
* I will update my log each day and push it to GitHub.
* I code at work but that time doesn't count towards this challenge.

## The Learn

These 100 days are focused on **improving my core JavaScript knowledge**. There are too many occasions where I am just struggling grasping basic JS concepts or writing it from scratch. Those moments need to disappear.
 
I am going to focus on a couple of key points:

* Refresh my basic JavaScript knowledge
    * [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) 
    * [Nodeschool](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting)
* Learning new syntax
    * [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/)
* Solving real world problems
    * [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)


The resources above are subject to change but should keep me busy the next 100 days.

## The Log
