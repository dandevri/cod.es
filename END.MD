What a hell of a ride.

This idea came about the end of december. I'm not exactly sure where it was (I think it was twitter) when I first saw the 100 days challenge.

My first thought was; I don't have the guts to keep it up for a streak of 100 days and why should I even bother. But then why the hell not? After finishing the Minor web Development and halfway trough my internship I started noticing that I was still struggling with even the basic JS concepts. From not knowing enough to not knowing at all.

It was this moment that I realized that these 100 days might be useful to force me to do learn these concepts and start taking action. By making it pubic I had more commitment to complete.

Here are a couple of takeaways;

## You form a habit
This one is a bit obvious but I really felt it. You just have this solid goal by the end of the day (on what time doesn't matter) that you have to complete this. I use Trello for daily tasks and just setup a reminder task everyday.

## You can do more than you think
When I first started I put some resources in the readme and thought that those kept me busy for atleast 100 days. In the end I worked my way trough far more resources than originally thought.

## The form of the resource does matter
I couldn't just read for a whole hour in a book I had to switch from time to time. Use different types of resource forms; read a book one week and watch a video course the other week. Switch it up.

## Split up time
The first week or two I just sat down for an hour straight but after I started noticing that I was more focussed by spliting up the time throughout the day. Maybe two sessions of 30 minutes or even three of 20 minutes.

## Track your time
And occasionaly look at the tracked time to get a grasp of you are progessing. Maybe the mornings you finish more resources than in the afternoon. It also gives you credibility, you can make the logged time public if you want to.

## Repition isn't bad
Covering the same topic or concept multiple times isn't bad. It's a nice refresher and most of the time the person handling the topic has a different way of explaining so you get multiple views on one specific topic.

Overall I can only say that it's well worth it;
* You do feel more confident while writing your JS program
* You become better at explaining these concepts to other people 
* Your code becomes more explicit because you make choices based on your knowledge
