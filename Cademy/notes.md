# JavaScript

Powers the dynamic behavior on most website.

Primitive data types; built-in forms of data.

When you introduce a new piece of data in JS the browser saves it as an instance. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type. JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like 'Hello', as a string instance in the computer's memory.

A string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed.

Instance methods, by definition, require that you create an instance before you can use them. Libraries contain methods that you can call without creating an instance.

## Variables
Programmers use variables to write code that is easy to understand and repurpose. 

## Control Flow
Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition. 

## Functions
A function is a block of code designed to perform a task. Functions are like recipes. They accept data, perform actions on that data, and return a result. any code between curly braces is also known as a block.  The purpose of a function is to take some input, perform some task on that input, then return a result. When functions return their value, we can use them together and inside one another. 

Functions in JavaScript are generally declared as either a function declaration or a function expression. A function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier or name. 

A function expression is similar to function declaration, with the exception that identifier can be omitted, creating an anonymous function.

The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body.

## Scope
Scope refers to where a variable can be accessed in a program. 

## Arrays
-

## Loops
-

## Iterators
Looping over arrays is a pretty common task. These methods, called iterators, are called on arrays and complete such tasks as altering each element and selecting elements that fit certain criteria.

## Objects
-

## Classes
Create an object class that can serve as a template.

Class and object syntax are a little bit different, classes need a constructor method every time you create a new instance.
An instance is an object that contains the property names and methods of a class, but with unique property values. 

### Inheritance
When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates for inheritance. With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses) share. 

## Browser compatibility
This has become a widespread concern for web developers since Ecma International, the organization responsible for standardizing JavaScript, released a new version of it in 2015, called ECMAScript2015, commonly referred to as ES6.

The version of JavaScript that preceded ES6 is called JavaScript ES5.   
* JavaScript ES6 is syntactically more similar to other object-oriented programming languages. 
* Readability and economy of code
* Addresses sources of ES5 bugs â€” Some ES5 syntax led to common bugs. 

Because ES6 is predictably backwards compatible, a collection of JavaScript programmers developed a JavaScript library called Babel that transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5. 

## Modules
JavaScript modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program. 
module is a variable that represents the module, and exports exposes the module as an object.

require() is a JavaScript function that enables a module to load by passing in the module's filepath as a parameter.
