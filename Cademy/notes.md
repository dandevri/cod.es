# JavaScript

Powers the dynamic behavior on most website.

Primitive data types; built-in forms of data.

When you introduce a new piece of data in JS the browser saves it as an instance. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type. JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like 'Hello', as a string instance in the computer's memory.

A string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed.

Instance methods, by definition, require that you create an instance before you can use them. Libraries contain methods that you can call without creating an instance.

## Variables
Programmers use variables to write code that is easy to understand and repurpose. 

## Control Flow
Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition.
