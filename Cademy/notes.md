# JavaScript

Powers the dynamic behavior on most website.

Primitive data types; built-in forms of data.

When you introduce a new piece of data in JS the browser saves it as an instance. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type. JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like 'Hello', as a string instance in the computer's memory.

A string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed.

Instance methods, by definition, require that you create an instance before you can use them. Libraries contain methods that you can call without creating an instance.

## Variables
Programmers use variables to write code that is easy to understand and repurpose. 

## Control Flow
Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition. 

## Functions
A function is a block of code designed to perform a task. Functions are like recipes. They accept data, perform actions on that data, and return a result. any code between curly braces is also known as a block.  The purpose of a function is to take some input, perform some task on that input, then return a result. When functions return their value, we can use them together and inside one another. 

Functions in JavaScript are generally declared as either a function declaration or a function expression. A function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier or name. 

A function expression is similar to function declaration, with the exception that identifier can be omitted, creating an anonymous function.

The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body.

## Scope
Scope refers to where a variable can be accessed in a program.
