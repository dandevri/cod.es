## Overview

Coverage of commonly-encountered types of code blocks. (Conditional statements, loops, functions)

## Making decisions in your code
Different actions according to inputs. We as humans make decisions all the time. Conditional statements allow us to represent decisions in JavaScript.

* An if else statement is also valid if you don't include the else keyword. The second code block is always run. Regardless of the condition. Most of the time you want to run the code block or the other.

Conditional statements always test boolean values.

> Any value that is not false returns true when tested.

You can nest if .. else if you want. 

If you want to test multiple conditions without nesting 'logical' operators can be used.

Not logical operator can be used to negate an expression. (It reverses the if / else aswell)

Any other value then zero evaluaties to true.

If else can be good for a couple of choices and when you have complex conditions. Switch statement are good for single values as input and many choices.

Ternary operators are good for just true or false returns. It requires less syntax then if else.

## Looping Code

> Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks.

Programming loops are all to do with doing the same thing over and over again â€” which is termed iteration in programming speak.

* Counter; initialized value
* Exit condition: when the loop stops
* Iterator; increments the counter

Loops are great for doing the same thing over and over again. Rapidly completing repetitive tasks.
