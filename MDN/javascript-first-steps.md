# JavaScript first steps

## What is JavaScript
3 layers: structure, presentation & interactivity

* Core JavaScript; basic programming functionality
* Browser API's; built into the browser. Expose data from computer environment.
* Third party API's; not built into the browser and expose data from other resources.

>  When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). 

The JavaScript is executed by the JavaScript engine, after the HTML and CSS.

Every browser tab has its own execution environment.

Running order for JavaScript is from top to bottom.

* Interpreted languages; JavaScript result is returned for the code to immediately run in the browser.
* Compiled languages; transformed before they are run by the computer.
* Client side; run on the user's computer. When a web page is viewed the code is downloaded and run by the browser.
* Server side; run on the server. Results are downloaded and displayed by browser.

Dynamic describes both client and server-side.

> Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the server, e.g. pulling data from a database, whereas client-side JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client.

The meaning is slightly different in the two contexts, but related, and both approaches (server-side and client-side) usually work together.

**No inline JavaScript handlers** You then mix interactivity with structure.

## A first splash into JavaScript

> One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems.

This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice.
