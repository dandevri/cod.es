# Computer Basics

## Hardware
Input > CPU |  Memory > Output 
Only CPU can access the memory. Memory; RAM short term memory. Or long Term hard drive cd-rom.
Motherboard connects everything. Expansion cards are sound cards etc.

A chip is full of transistors. Little switches that can be 1 or 0. Amount of transistors make the chip faster.

Motherboard makes connection between CPU and memory. But most motherboards do alot more. (ports, expansion)

Hardware; parts of the computer
Software; programs that run on the hardware
* Operating System
* Applications

## Binary
There is 'bi' just two things. Binaries are 1 and 0s. Mostly meant to be letters and numbers.
Computers can understand a bit. On top of that we got the byte, 8-bits together. All numbers and letters can be broken down into bytes. Everything you write in JS code can be converted to byte.

## Data size
Bits per second (speed is something different then size) Internet and network speed are two different things.

## Computers
* Super
* Server
* Workstation
* PC

It's not PC or MAC. Both of them are personal computers.

## Network
Data networks.
* lan; small group of computers
* wan; two local networks that are connected rent cable from isp
* vpn; use the internet

Internet can only deliver something to an IP address. Each device has one. IP adress are based on location. Each number in the IP adress is a more specific location.

## Internet
Device > modem > router. Request response to a server (web server)

CDN; Deliver content to the user as fast as possible. CDN's pay ISP for the faster route. Servers across the world.

Routers connect all the devices in a local area. Each router only has to know it's own little network. The information that get sends are called packets.

## Analog vs Digital
Computer measures waves (this is called sampling) and turn them into numbers.

## Source Code
Text document that a programmer creates. The computer needs a way to interpreter that.
* interpreter; browser interpret it
* compiler; product is already compiled (on programmers end)

All documentation and source code can be accessible. This is called open-source.

## Console
Display system messages; tool for debugging. 

## Variables
-

Dictionary attacks.
