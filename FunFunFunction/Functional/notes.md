# Functional Programming in JavaScript

## 1 - Higher Order Functions
Functional programming wil make you more secure with programming and be a overall better developer.
Easier to read, more reusable.

'Functions are values'. You can pass it around like any other value.

composition; compose small function into bigger function
When we write software in small simple functions they compose together.

Functions you send into other functions are callback functions. Callback function can thus be stored in variable.

## 2 - Map
Map always return the full length of the array but then transformed.
Arrow functions; shorter syntax for functions. Mostly used in callbacks.

## 3 - Reduce basics
List transformation, they are pretty specific. Reduce can be useful for more tranforms.
Reduce is multi-tool.

## 4 - Reduce advanced
Strings and other data types are basically just bytes. You need to transform it; use character encoding. Most common is utf-8.

## 5 - Closures
Functions are also closures. The function body has access to variables that are defines outside the functions scope.
the function will remember the outer context.
callbacks do have access to the variables inside the outer function.
Closures is one of the concepts that are really important to JS. Have to use alot in your own code.
