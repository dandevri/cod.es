### Day 1: 01.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 66 items of the freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges.

**Notes:** Most of the stuff I use on the daily so it was pretty easy to go trough the challenges. It is a nice refresher for the terminology. Most of the time you just write lines without really thinking so it's nice to read the description of each challenge and freshen up JavaScript terminology.

* `Declaring and iniatilizing variables`
* `Calling or Invoking a function`
* `Data types within JavaScript (undefined, null, nan)`
* `Assignment, Arithmetic, Compound operators`

**Results:** You can see my contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 00m 36s
