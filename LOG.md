### Day 1: 01.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 66 items of the freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges.

**Notes:** Most of the stuff I use on the daily so it was pretty easy to go trough the challenges. It is a nice refresher for the terminology. Most of the time you just write lines without really thinking so it's nice to read the description of each challenge and freshen up JavaScript terminology.

* `Declaring and iniatilizing variables`
* `Calling or Invoking a function`
* `Data types within JavaScript (undefined, null, nan)`
* `Assignment, Arithmetic, Compound operators`

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 00m 36s

### Day 2: 02.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 24 items of the freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges.

**Notes:** Had a pretty long day at work and started late with my daily hour. Would like to do spend some time in the morning (on commute) and maybe split that hour up in multiple time frames. These challenges take some more time and combined with the time is the reason why I didn't complete that many of them. Hope I can finish up the Basic JavaScript course tomorrow and start with the Functional Program section.

* `Else statements`
* `Switch Statements`
* `Objects; properties, keys, values`
* `Accessing values with dot and bracket notation`
* `Manipulating 'complex' objects (with nested objects and arrays)`

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 01m 46s

### Day 3: 03.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 28 items of the freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript and Functional Programming challenges.

**Notes:** Finished the Basic Javascript and Functional challenges as stated yesterday. Might go through the Functional ones again tomorrow to make sure I got those down. I split up my session today, 30 in the morning and 30 in the evening, feels like a nice balance so it's not that heavy to do all at once in the evening.

* `For, While (loops) statements`
* `Basic Regular Expressions`
* `Objects and constructors`
* `Array Methods (map, filter)`

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 01m 59s

### Day 4: 04.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp Functional programming section again and finished 4 algorithm challenges.

**Notes:** Spend the morning during my commute to go over the Functional programming section again. Nice to really get this down. In the evening I worked on the Algorithm challenges. The code of each challenge isn't really that 'hard' but researching to get the right answers takes some time.

* It really helps to split up each scripting challenge in really small steps.
* Don't give up and go to the hint too early. If I had taken a little more time I could have completed the *palindrome challenge* on my own but went to the hint instead. Prefer to take some more time (and do less challenges at the end of the day) then to go to the hint straight away. 
* I don't think all of these challenges are things you come across everyday but they sure make you think like a programmer. Search for the problems in the documentation and take one step at a time.

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri) but since I went trough the functional program section again you don't see those contributions in the graph.

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 08m 52s

### Day 5: 05.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 4 Basic Algorithm challenges.

**Notes:** It's pretty frustrating that from the four challenges I need to see the hints for two them. I get to around 80% of the desired result and I can't finish the last 20%. It's mostly just one word or one line and that bothers me. Maybe I need to change my strategy for searching or need to make a rule that I finish the challenge without looking at the hint. Once you see part of the solution you get that aha moment and I can complete it but maybe it feels even better if I can complete one without looking.

Also thinking about switching it up more. Doing those challenges for one hour straight is pretty frustrating at moments. Oh well, maybe I just need to bite the bullet.

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 06m 47s

### Day 6: 06.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 2 Basic Algorithm challenges and spend the rest of the day on the NodeSchool Javascripting Workshopper.

**Notes:** Not the most focused day, didn't really feel like I made alot of progress. Felt a bit distracted. I really like the interactive workshopper from NodeSchool it feels more hands on instead of being stuck in the freeCodeCamp editor. With what I was thing earlier, I do feel like I can get more done if I don't to the algorithm challenge for a full hour but switch it up with another resource.

So the goal is to maybe 2 or 3 algorithm challenges (30 minutes) and spend the rest of the hour on another resource. Then the hour minimum goes by really quickly and I even feel like I can code for more than the minimum hour while it's still feels fun.

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri). I've pushed the NodeSchool Workshopper exercises to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [NodeSchool Workshopper - JavaScripting](https://www.github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)

**Time:** 1h 04m 32s


### Day 7: 07.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 3 Basic Algorithm challenges and finished the NodeSchool JavaScripting challenges.

**Notes:** The Basic Algorithm challenges are coming to an end and I've finished the NodeSchool challenges. I did more resources then expected in the first week. These resources may not be the most challenging right now but still, when I started I thought these would take me more time to complete. The goal is to finish the Basic algorithm challenges tomorrow and then if I have time left figure out what resource to take next. 

Probably going to do [one](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop) or [two]
(https://github.com/workshopper/scope-chains-closures) JavaScript related workshoppers from NodeSchool and read through the [MDN - Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) section about JavaScript. They explain some of the more topics a little bit more in-depth.

After that I think I've freshened up my basic JavaScript knowledge enough to start with the ES6 course by Wes Bos and then move onto JavaScript 30 cause it uses some ES6 syntax.

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri). I've pushed the NodeSchool Workshopper exercises to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [NodeSchool Workshopper - JavaScripting](https://www.github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)

**Time:** 1h 06m 08s

### Day 8: 08.01.2018  

**Progress**: Started with the Functional JavaScript workshopper.

**Notes:** Didn't really grasp the concepts of this Workshopper and felt they were a little too verbose for my taste. Maybe it's nice to do these again in a later stadium but for now I don't really think I grasp the concepts that well. Still pushed the first couple of challenges to this repo.

Think it's better to finish the remaining freeCodeCamp Algorithm challenges first and learn some more basic stuff from the MDN documentation. Maybe look at some more basic 'easy' resources to do in the meantime.

**Results:** I've pushed the first NodeSchool Workshopper exercises to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [NodeSchool Workshopper - Functional JavaScript](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop)

**Time:** 1h 03m 33s


### Day 9: 09.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 2 Basic Algorithm challenges and started reading the MDN Learn Web Development Resource.

**Notes:** Still really like the mix between practical examples and reading. The MDN documentation is really written with beginners in mind. It's nice as a refresher and I really like how clear it's written but for me it can be a little more complex but I suppose that will come later. It's never a bad idea to skim trough some basic terminology.

Hope to finish the last two algorithm challenges tomorrow so I can check those off. Maybe even do them again later in the 100 days and see if I made any improvements and if I can complete them faster with less hints.

I do feel like that it's best to sit at home for more practical examples so I can focus more and in the train do some casual reading while taking notes.

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri). The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [MDN - Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)


**Time:** 1h 01m 12s

### Day 10: 10.01.2018

**Progress**: Progress wasn't tracked.

**Notes:** So I kinda coded for about 65Â± minutes today while I had some time left at work. So I kinda broke the rule that coding at work doesn't count towards 'official' time. But that's kinda not also true because I was reading some more JavaScript MDN documentation, just not the one where I left off. So I also kinda tracked my time doing it. So I kinda let this one slip trough the cracks and will spent atleast 2 hours tomorrow to kinda compensate.

### Day 11: 11.01.2018  

**Progress**: Continued reading the MDN - Learn Web Development JavaScript section.

**Notes:** As stated before, it's really nice to read these sections on MDN. They have a nice balance between theory and practical examples. The descriptions are one of the clearest I've read. It's nice that they also make a clean distinction between core JavaScript language theory and Browser specific elements.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [MDN - JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)
* [MDN - What is JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

* [MDN - Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables)

**Time:** 1h 27m 58s

### Day 12: 12.01.2018  

**Progress**: Finished reading the first JavaScript Learn Web Development Module.

**Notes:** The section covered most of the basic JavaScript keywords and data types. Nice to go trough and while reading I try to code along. The theory is mostly the same from freeCodeCamp but they focus a bit more on assignments and practical examples. MDN does have some 'active learning' parts in it but they just explain a little bit more in-depth. 

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [MDN - Basic Math in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math)

* [MDN - Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays)

**Time:** 1h 02m 13s

### Day 13: 13.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed the last 2 freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Challenges and further reading on the MDN JavaScript section.

**Notes:** Finally finished the last 2 challenges so I can check that off the list. Maybe further into these 100 days I will maybe continue with the Intermediate challenges. I do like them but they mostly only cover JavaScript core language features. The thing that I like about the MDN documentation is that the cover a bit more practical use cases in the Browser.

As a side note, I started using [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) for tracking my Time. Before I just set a quick timer inside Google but with Toggl I can track the time a bit more in-depth and see at what times of the day I spent time on this challenge.

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri). The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

* [MDN - Looping Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code)

**Time:** 1h 02m 43s

### Day 14: 14.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Same as yesterday and probably the same for the upcoming days, reading through the MDN documentation and typing along with all the code examples. By not just reading it but also writing and doing the examples you have a much more hands-on experience and I feel like I can remember more.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Time:** 1h 02m 10s

### Day 15: 15.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Finished the Building Blocks section and now on to the JavaScript objects section. Read the events documentation twice, some very useful in-depth stuff about events that's nice to know by default.

Ermargherd, lost my streak ð Note to self; commit before 00:00.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:**

**Time:** 1h 05m 33s

### Day 16: 16.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Started with the JavaScript objects section. The theory is a little more intense then all the previous stuff but the explanation feels so clear. These are things you are gonna use very often when you OOP. So I really want to take the time and go over this section pretty slowly, even reading some sections twice. 

Finally understanding a bit more about objects and how they are created. It's one of those things I just started using but not really knowing the basics of it.

* Namespacing / Encapsulated
* Constructor Functions
* Object Literals
* Object instances

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [MDN - Object Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)
* [MDN - Object Oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)

**Time:** 1h 06m 56s

### Day 17: 17.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** These last sections are ð¤¯  On a positive note I finally understand some under the hood objects stuff.
* Prototype chain
* Prototype objects
* Constructor property

It's worth nothing that some of the stuff is still a bit vague, it doesn't hurt to read through these sections again

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:** 
* [MDN - Object Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)

**Time:** 1h 02m 41s

### Day 18: 18.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Read through the first sections of the objects theory to get those down. Then read more about inheritance in JavaScript. As stated in the documentation what I referred to yesterday.

> Prototypes and inheritance represent some of the most complex aspects of JavaScript, but a lot of JavaScript's power and flexibility comes from its object structure and inheritance, and it is worth understanding how it works.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Time:** 1h 02m 14s

### Day 19: 19.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Pretty straightforward; reading back some of the object sections and started with the JSON one. Almost done with the whole Object section and then move onto the Web API's. That's the last section on MDN that focusses on JavaScript.

* JSON is basically a string and you need to convert it to a JS object.
* Resembles JavaScript object literal syntax.

**Time:** 1h 03m 46s

### Day 20: 20.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Noticing that in the weekend and the last couple of days I am getting distracted too often. Because I am reading the same type of documentation for the last week it's just reading and sometime examples. Don't feel the same focus that I had the first week. 

* Basic canvas visualisation with objects
* What APIs are and how they work
* Types of APIs 
* Relationship other JS tooling

**Time:** 1h 06m 01s

### Day 22: 22.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** When it's a bit late at night I tend to not write any notes. 

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

*Added wrong date to commit*

**Time:** 1h 05m 47s


### Day 23: 23.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** The MDN learning section is slowly coming to an end. Probably in a couple of days I will have read all the sections. Maybe it's a good idea to think about the next learning section. As stated before it's probably a good idea to do the ES6 course to learn new syntax and then move onto the JavaScript 30 exercises.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Time:** 1h 03m 52s

### Day 24: 24.01.2018  

**Progress**: Further reading MDN Learn Web Development.

**Notes:** Last couple of days I had to really fit in this challenge since I was aways most of the day, it was pretty tough but still managed to code during those days. It's really nice to split the time, half of it in the morning and half of it at night. Really feel like I'm more focussed if I code a bit earlier in the night.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

**Resources:** 

* [MDN - Video and Audio APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs)
* [MDN - Client-side Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage)

**Time:** 1h 04m 30s

### Day 25: 25.01.2018  

**Progress**: Finished the whole MDN Learn Web Development JavaScript sections.

**Notes:** The last one about client-side storage was a bit rough. Nice to grasp some of the concepts but maybe a bit out of scope for my personal taste. There are alot more JavaScript resources and basic topics that I want to learn but I think it's a nice change of pace to start with the ES6 course from Wes Bos. So I understand some modern new syntax and how to use it. Then I can always go back to a bit more basic resources after that.

**Results:** The notes and examples from the MDN resources are pushed to this repo.

* [MDN - Client-side Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage)

**Time:** 1h 06m 48s

### Day 26: 26.01.2018  

**Progress**: Started with the ES6 Course from Wes Bos and completed the first module.

**Notes:** Nice to start with some video tutorials a couple weeks in, most of the resources i've been reading where text based. I feel like with video tutorials I can do more of it without losing focus. Sometimes with reading after 45 / 50 min I feel a bit sluggish, with video's it isn't like that at all.

It's also because of Wes Bos his style, nice and quick paced and you can easily follow it while taking notes. I've made a new seperate repository for the course.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 03m 42s

### Day 27: 27.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed the second module (arrow functions) from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** Long and nice sprint. (almost double the one hour minimum) Nice and easy day this weekend so I could spend some more time. Same as before; really like to do video tutorials and Wes explanations are really good. That ofcourse contributes to the time spent on learning.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 40m 52s

### Day 28: 28.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed the third module (template literals) from the ES6 course.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 07m 02s

### Day 29: 29.01.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the fourth and fifth module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** Destructuring seems really useful when using objects and data that get returned from an API. You can easily target and assign values.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 01m 30s

### Day 30: 30.01.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the sixth and seventh module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** 77 video's seemed pretty long but if you do a couple of video's every day (complete one or two modules in the hour) then it goes pretty fast. Even halway through the video's right now, didn't expect that. I quickly try to read my notes back from the previous section but I still get that I can't remember all of it. It's nice to know that a functionality exists but the syntax can be a little funky.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 03m 02s

### Day 31: 31.01.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the 8th and 9th module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** Already one month in, doing pretty good so far. Some of the things I notice so far:
* Getting more comfortable writing JS
* Writing more consice and readable code
* You don't learn everything by just watching one JS course. You have to keep up, write code and try to learn new concepts all the time.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 05m 54s

### Day 32: 01.02.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the 10th and 11th module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** Same as stated yesterday, with a course you get to know general concepts but you also need to make examples and apply them. Find use cases for them and just use them during projects. Next up are some interesting chapters about eslint and npm tooling.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Resources:** 

* [Wes Bos ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/)

**Time:** 1h 02m 34s

### Day 33: 02.02.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the 12th module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** ESLint is ð¥ Didn't even know about the commit hooks.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

**Time:** 1h 00m 10s

### Day 34: 03.02.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the 13th module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** This and the last section were really good, nice little sidestep form straight up learning new syntax but also some context and 'actually' building something.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).

### Day 35: 04.02.2018  

**Progress:** Completed the 14th module from the ES6 course.

**Notes:** So far it's going pretty great if I think about it. It's pretty mind blown how many you can learn (even in 35 days) if you just take 1 hour each day. Being consistent is the most important thing.

**Results:** Pushed the notes and examples to the [ES6 repo](https://github.com/dandevri/es6.io).
