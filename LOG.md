### Day 1: 01.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 66 items of the freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges.

**Notes:** Most of the stuff I use on the daily so it was pretty easy to go trough the challenges. It is a nice refresher for the terminology. Most of the time you just write lines without really thinking so it's nice to read the description of each challenge and freshen up JavaScript terminology.

* `Declaring and iniatilizing variables`
* `Calling or Invoking a function`
* `Data types within JavaScript (undefined, null, nan)`
* `Assignment, Arithmetic, Compound operators`

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).

**Resources:** [freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Time:** 1h 00m 36s

### Day 2: 02.01.2018  

**Progress**: Completed 24 items of the freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges.

**Notes:** Had a pretty long day at work and started late with my daily hour. Would like to do spend some time in the morning (on commute) and maybe split that hour up in multiple time frames. These challenges take some more time and combined with the time is the reason why I didn't complete that many of them. Hope I can finish up the Basic JavaScript course tomorrow and start with the Functional Program section.

* `Else statements`
* `Switch Statements`
* `Objects; properties, keys, values`
* `Accessing values with dot and bracket notation`
* `Manipulating 'complex' objects (with nested objects and arrays)`

**Results:** You can see the contributions on my [freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dandevri).
