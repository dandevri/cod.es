# Chapter 3 - Into YDKJS

> Serious developers in other languages expect to put in the effort to learn most or all of the language(s) they primarily write in, but JS developers seem to stand out from the crowd in the sense of typically not learning very much of the language. This is not a good thing, and it's not something we should continue to allow to be the norm.

It challenges you to go beyond your comfort zone and to ask the deeper "why" questions for every single behavior you encounter.

## Scope & Closures
The Scope & Closures title starts by debunking the common misconception that JS is an "interpreted language" and therefore not compiled. Nope. The JS engine compiles your code right before (and sometimes during!) execution

## This
The this keyword is dynamically bound based on how the function in question is executed, and it turns out there are four simple rules to understand and fully determine this binding.

Unfortunately, the desire to bring class and inheritance design pattern thinking to JavaScript is just about the worst thing you could try to do, because while the syntax may trick you into thinking there's something like classes present, in fact the prototype mechanism is fundamentally opposite in its behavior.

## Types
Perhaps no topic causes more frustration with JS developers than when you talk about the confusions surrounding implicit coercion.

## Async
The first three titles of this series focus on the core mechanics of the language, but the fourth title branches out slightly to cover patterns on top of the language mechanics for managing asynchronous programming.

## ES6
No matter how much you feel you've mastered JavaScript to this point, the truth is that JavaScript is never going to stop evolving, and moreover, the rate of evolution is increasing rapidly. 

## Review
The YDKJS series is dedicated to the proposition that all JS developers can and should learn all of the parts of this great language. No person's opinion, no framework's assumptions, and no project's deadline should be the excuse for why you never learn and deeply understand JavaScript.
